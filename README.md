# Hi, I'm Leo Leaipailote üëã
## ‚≠êÔ∏è About Me:
- I am a new Computer Science graduate from Colgate University (I feel old age catching up to me already). I've always been interested in how things work, and since most things involve technology these days, it didn't really surprise me that I ended up drawn to CS. Feel free to check out my repos and join me on my journey of tinkering with new technologies. (Also don't be shocked if my commit messages are a little unhinged, debugging brings out the worst in me).

## üíª Tech Stack:
- **Programing Lanugages**: Python, Java, JavaScript, C, Ruby, HTML, CSS
- **Technologies**: React, ReactNative, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Ruby-on-Rails, SpringBoot
- I‚Äôve been working with the MERN stack quite a lot lately, and have used it to develop full-stack applications. It's a very versatile tech stack that allows me to cover both the front and back-end in JavaScript while also having a lot of flexibility with MongoDB's schema-less database storage.
- I've also worked with Ruby-On-Rails in the past to create one of my proudest projects - Foodie! - a food-ordering app designed to connect local businesses with students on my college campus. The emphasis on convention-over-configuration made it quite challenging to learn at first, but as I became more proficient with it, I found that Rails' handling of all the background dirty work makes it very easy to work with.
- I recently began dabbling with SpringBoot and Maven for app development with my projects and found it very interesting to work with. I discovered that I could put many of the object-oriented programming principles I had learnt in my introductory CS classes to good use, making it surprisingly easy to pick-up.

## üöÄ What I'm working on now: 
- I'm currently working on developing a stronger understanding of AI and machine learning in general. I'm curious as to how LLMs are used and developed as ChatBots are becoming more and more common these days. Recommenders are another area where I see AI being used quite frequently and I am in the process of experimenting with both of these through a couple of personal projects which will be on here soon!
  
## üì´ How to reach me:
- I admittedly get a bit too absorbed in programming sometimes, and I need to keep reminding myself to touch grass, so please don't hesitate to reach out to me for any questions about my projects, or better yet work with me on one - social interaction is a little underrated these days.
