- 👋 Hi, my name is Leo Leaipailote and I am a new Computer Science graduate from Colgate University (I feel old age catching up to me already). I've always been interested in how things work, and since most things involve technology these days, it didn't really surprise me that I ended up drawn to CS. Feel free to check out my repos and join me on my journey of tinkering with new technologies. (Also don't be shocked if my commit messages are a little unhinged, debugging brings out the worst in me)
